<h1>QR Code Generator</h1>
This project uses the great free API - https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code
<br><br>
This is a very simple project that did not require a great setup, but was really helpful in learning how API's work alongside HTML/CSS/JAVA and I will be using this to create plenty of QR codes for my portfolio website1
